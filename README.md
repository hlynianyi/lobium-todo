# User stories

1. List my TODOs
Description: As a user I would like to list my current todos
Acceptance criteria:
- Each todo could have, at minimal, a related state and title + some hard-coded todos will be initialised in this context to demonstrate the tool


2. Change a TODO state
Description: As a user I would like to change a todo state by checking a "box"
Acceptance criteria:
- When a todo is done, it should be placed at the bottom of the list and should be crossed out


3. Add a new TODO
Description: As a user I would like to add a new todo in my list
Acceptance criteria:
- The todo title is required
- The todo description can be empty
- The newly created todo has to be on top of the list of todos
- You are free to choose the design / interaction
